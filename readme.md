## Topics

**A selection of the following topics is presented in the lectures**:

- Key scientific tasks common to many scientific domains, such as simulation, inverse problems, equation discovery, design, and control problems, and issues with traditional methods for solving them
- Physics-informed neural networks for solving forward, inverse and equation discovery problems related to PDEs
- Neural operators, including Fourier neural operators, Convolutional neural operators and DeepONets, for learning efficient surrogate models, and their theoretical foundations
- Differentiable scientific algorithms, neural differential equations, and the benefits of hybrid workflows
- AI for symbolic regression and equation discovery
- Applications of graph neural networks in science
- Large language models and other Foundation models for scientific discovery

Applications using these techniques will be illustrated across fluid dynamics, wave physics, medical physics, molecular design, and computational biology. Several examples where AI algorithms outperform traditional scientific workflows will be shown.
